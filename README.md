The target audience of this application is everyone who receives unsolicited
phone calls from telemarketers and other spammers. The application helps to
solve this problem by providing a means to look up the location and reputation
of any given 10-digit US phone number. We do this by displaying a search box,
a map, address (when possible), various reputation metrics, and a list of
recent searches.

APIs used:
- Google Firebase
- Google Maps
- Whitepages Pro Phone Reputation
- Whitepages Pro Reverse Phone

Libraries used:
- Bootstrap
